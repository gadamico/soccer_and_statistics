# soccer_and_statistics

This repository explores statistical questions that arise in the context of soccer competition.

In the first part of a soccer tournament (like the World Cup) teams are often divided into groups, and every team in that group will play every other team in that group. The results of this "round-robin" play will determine the teams to advance to the single-elimination tournament (or "knockout round"). A team will earn three points for a win and one point for a tie.

Very often a group will comprise four teams. For a four-team group, how many different game outcomes are possible? How many different sets of final standings are possible? **How many different sets of final standings are possible if we abstract away from the team identities?**

This last question is what I want to pursue here. As we shall see, the complexity of this problem grows quickly as we increase the number of teams in our group.
